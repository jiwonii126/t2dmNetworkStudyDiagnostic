# t2dmNetworkStudyDiagnostic

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a globally prevalent chronic metabolic disorder requiring long-term pharmacological management to prevent complications and improve patients’ quality of life. With the increasing availability and diversity of anti-diabetic medications-including first-line agents such as metformin and second-line options like DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists-there is a growing need to understand real-world treatment patterns to inform clinical guidelines and public health strategies.

This study was designed as a feasibility assessment to evaluate whether newly mapped to the OMOP CDM can reliably support observational research involving T2DM patients.

 By profiling individuals who initiated anti-diabetic medications and met basic diagnostics criteria, we aim to:

•	Assess data completeness, coding consistency, and representativeness,

•	Identify potential biases or data gaps,

•	Align our population with those used in prior OHDSI studies, such as LEGEND-T2DM

•	And where feasible, identify and describe treatment patterns, including medication sequences, switching behaviors, and adherence trends
